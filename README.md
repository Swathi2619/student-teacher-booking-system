Student–Teacher Booking System

This project is a web-based application that allows students to book appointments with teachers.
It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase for authentication and database.
Users can register, log in, view teachers, and create booking requests.
Teachers/admins can manage schedules and view bookings easily.
The app uses Firestore Security Rules for safe read/write access.
Data is stored in Cloud Firestore with real-time updates.
The interface is simple, clean, and responsive for both students and admins.
This project demonstrates CRUD operations, Firebase Auth, and role-based access control.
Useful for learning real-time database apps with secure backend logic.
